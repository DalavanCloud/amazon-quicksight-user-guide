# Working with Dashboards<a name="working-with-dashboards"></a>

A *dashboard* is a read\-only snapshot of an analysis that you can share with other Amazon QuickSight users for reporting purposes\. A dashboard preserves the configuration of the analysis at the time you create it, including such things as filtering and sort order\. The data used for the analysis is not captured as part of the dashboard\. When you view the dashboard, it will reflect the current data in the data sets used by the analysis\.

When you share a dashboard, you specify which users have access to it\. These users can view and filter the dashboard data\. Any filters applied to the dashboard visuals exist only while the user is viewing the dashboard, and aren't saved once it is closed\.
