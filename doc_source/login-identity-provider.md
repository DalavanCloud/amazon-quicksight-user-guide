# Signing In to Amazon QuickSight Using an Identity Provider<a name="login-identity-provider"></a>

If your organization uses an identity provider, you must first sign in through the identity provider before you use Amazon QuickSight\. 

An identity provider supports single sign\-on \(SSO\) access\. This type of access means you don't need to provide sign\-in information to Amazon QuickSight\. When you access Amazon QuickSight, you shouldn't see a sign\-in screen\. 

If you do see a sign\-in screen in this case, no credentials will work\. You must sign in through your identity provider instead of on this sign\-in screen\. Then you can use Amazon QuickSight\.
