# Adding a Filter<a name="add-a-filter"></a>

You can create a filter on any field from the data set associated with the currently selected visual\. If you want to create a filter for a different data set, choose a visual that uses that data set\. When you create a filter, it applies by default to just the currently selected visual\. You can apply the filter to additional visual that use that data set after you create it\.

Once you apply a filter to a visual, a filter icon appears on the visual so you can identify at a glance that the data is filtered\.
