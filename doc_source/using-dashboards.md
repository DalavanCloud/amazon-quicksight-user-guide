## Viewing Dashboard Data<a name="viewing-dashboard-data"></a>

You can scroll through and view the details of any visual in a dashboard, and focus on or exclude visual elements, the same way you can in an analysis\. You can also update chart colors on the visuals\. Any changes you make exist for your current viewing session only, and aren't saved\. For more information about viewing visual data, see [Viewing Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](viewing-visual-data.md)\. For more information about changing chart colors, see [Changing Visual Colors in Amazon QuickSight](changing-visual-colors.md)\.

## Filtering Dashboard Data<a name="filtering-dashboard-data"></a>

You can filter the data of any visual in a dashboard, the same way you can in an analysis, but filters in dashboards exist for your current viewing session only, and aren't saved\. For more information about filtering visual data, see [Filtering Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](filtering-visual-data.md)\.

## Export Data from a Dashboard to a CSV file<a name="export-dashboard-to-csv"></a>

To export data from an analysis or dashboard to a comma\-separated values \(CSV\) file, follow the procedure in [Exporting Data from an Amazon QuickSight Visual to a CSV File](export-visual-to-csv.md)\.
