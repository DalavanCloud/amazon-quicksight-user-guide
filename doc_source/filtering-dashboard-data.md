# Filtering Dashboard Data<a name="filtering-dashboard-data"></a>

You can filter the data of any visual in a dashboard, the same way you can in an analysis, but filters in dashboards exist for your current viewing session only, and aren't saved\. For more information about filtering visual data, see [Filtering Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](filtering-visual-data.md)\.
