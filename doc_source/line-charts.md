# Using Line Charts<a name="line-charts"></a>

Use line charts to compare changes in measure values over period of time, for the following scenarios: 

+ One measure over a period of time, for example gross sales by month\. 

+ Multiple measures over a period of time, for example gross sales and net sales by month\. 

+ One measure for a dimension over a period of time, for example number of flight delays per day by airline\. 

Line charts show the individual values of a set of measures or dimensions against the range displayed by the Y axis\. Area line charts differ from regular line charts in that each value is represented by a colored area of the chart instead of just a line, to make it easier to evaluate item values relative to each other\.

For example, discount amount by year by region looks like the following in a line chart\.

It looks like the following in an area line chart\.

Each line on the chart represents a measure value across a period of time\. When you have a chart with multiple lines, hover over any line to see a pop\-up legend that shows the values for each line for that point in time\.
