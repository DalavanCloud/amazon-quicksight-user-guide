# Quick Start Guide for QuickSight<a name="quickstart"></a>

Welcome to the *Quick Start Guide for QuickSight* designed for business analysts\.

Amazon QuickSight is a user\-friendly tool to help you create a wide variety of charts, graphs, tables, and other data visualizations\. You can then group these together to form stories and dashboards\. 

## How Does It Work?<a name="quick-intro"></a>

 You begin by choosing a dataset\. If you like, you can groom your dataset by adding new data elements, creating calculations, or filtering out data\. 

 When you're satisfied that the dataset works for you, you can begin to analyze it\. First, you can create a graphical representation of your data\. If you don't know what kind of visual you should use, Amazon QuickSight can help you by choosing a graphic type for you\.

 You can continue to add more visuals based on different views of the same underlying data\. To fit more visuals on a page, you can resize and rearrange them\.

 By creating a series of visuals, you create a story\. This visual narrative tells what is happening in the subject you're investigating\. You can save multiple stories, using filters to show how the data changes over time\. Any of these visuals can be shared with other people, who can then further analyze the data\. 

 If you choose, you can also publish dashboards\. These are read\-only snapshots that you can share for reporting\.
