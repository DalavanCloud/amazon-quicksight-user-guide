# Using Combo Charts<a name="combo-charts"></a>

Amazon QuickSight supports the following types of combo charts:

+ Clustered bar combo chart

+ Stacked bar combo chart

These are also known as line and column charts\.

Use the combo chart visual types to create a single visualization that shows two different types of data\. These two types are individually best suited to a line chart and a bar chart\. The difference between these two types can work well for comparing two sets of data, for example trends and categorical data\.

On the clustered bar combo chart, bars display for each child dimension, grouped by the parent dimension\. On the stacked bar combo chart, one bar displays per parent dimension\. Inside each bar, colors show the relative values of each item in the child dimension\. Both types of combo chart require only one dimension on the **X axis**, but are usually more effective when also displaying at least one measure under **Lines**\.
