# Managing User Accounts in Amazon QuickSight Enterprise Edition<a name="managing-users-enterprise"></a>

AWS administrators can use this topic to learn more about managing user accounts in Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edition\. For information about managing user accounts in Amazon QuickSight Standard edition, see [Managing User Accounts in Amazon QuickSight Standard Edition](managing-users.md)\.

You can add and remove Microsoft Active Directory directory groups to create and deactivate user accounts\. You can access the directory groups directly or by using the AD Connector\. To do this, you must have both administrative privileges in Amazon QuickSight and also appropriate AWS permissions\. For more information on the necessary AWS permissions, see [Setting Your IAM Policy](set-iam-policy.md)\.

Each Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edition account can have an unlimited number of user accounts\. User names that contain a semicolon \(` ; `\) aren't supported\.

Use the following procedures to add, view, and deactivate Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edition user accounts\.

**Important**  
If you are using Active Directory, you can't remap Amazon QuickSight users or groups from one identity store to another\. For example, if you are migrating from an on\-premises Active Directory to AWS Directory Service, or the other way around, you have to unsubscribe and resubscribe to Amazon QuickSight\. This requirement is because, even if the user's aliases remain the same, the underlying identity data changes\. To make the transition easier, request in advance that your users document all their Amazon QuickSight assets and settings before the migration\. 

## Adding User Accounts<a name="add-user-accounts-enterprise"></a>

You can manage users through Microsoft Active Directory \(AD\) groups\. You can create multiple user accounts at once by choosing one or more AD groups to integrate with Amazon QuickSight\. All users in the selected groups are authorized to sign in to Amazon QuickSight\. You can also add user accounts individually by adding those users to AD groups that are already integrated with Amazon QuickSight\. To see what groups are integrated with your Amazon QuickSight account, use the procedure in [Viewing User Account Details](#view-user-accounts-enterprise)\. For more information about adding a user to a Microsoft Active Directory directory group, see [Add Users and Groups \(Simple AD and Microsoft Active Directory\)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/creating_ad_users_and_groups.html)\. Or, you can read more about how to [Connect to a Directory](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_ad_connector.html) using AD Connector\.

Users created this way aren't automatically notified of their access to Amazon QuickSight\. You or your assigned Amazon QuickSight administrator must provide users with your Amazon QuickSight account name, the sign\-in URL \([https://quicksight\.aws\.amazon\.com/](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/)\), and instructions to sign in using their active directory credentials\. 

**Note**  
Although you can manage users through AD groups or as IAM users, you don't have to do it this way\. You can instead choose to invite Amazon QuickSightâ€“only users by email\. Choose the **Manage Users** feature of the **Manage QuickSight** page, and enter an email address to invite someone to join your Amazon QuickSight account\. Each user gets an email containing a link to Amazon QuickSight\. Using the invitation link, the user can then set up a user name and password in Amazon QuickSight\. Users can also request access through self provisioning\. For more information on requesting access, see [Provisioning users for Amazon QuickSight](provisioning-users.md)\.  
Amazon QuickSight subscriptions based on Active Directory can only have users provisioned in Active Directory\.

## Viewing User Account Details<a name="view-user-accounts-enterprise"></a>

You can view the Microsoft Active Directory directory groups integrated with Amazon QuickSight on the **Manage users** page\. Use the following procedure to view the Microsoft Active Directory directory groups that are integrated with Amazon QuickSight\.

1. Choose **Manage groups**\. You can manage both administrator and user groups from the Amazon QuickSight Management Console\.

1. On the AWS sign\-in page, enter your AWS or IAM credentials\.

1. Users with administrative privileges display under **Administrator groups**\. Those with user privileges display under **User groups**\.

## Deactivating Enterprise User Accounts<a name="deactivate-user-groups-enterprise"></a>

Deactivating a group or user account removes that group or user's access to Amazon QuickSight resources, like analyses or data sets\. However, it doesn't delete resources they own and it doesn't release their [SPICE](welcome.md#spice) capacity\. After deactivating a user, you can delete the user from your Amazon QuickSight account\. When you delete a user, QuickSight gives you the option to either delete the user's resources or transfer their resources to another user\.

To deactivate a user account individually, remove that user from all Microsoft Active Directory directory groups that are integrated with Amazon QuickSight\. To view the groups integrated with your Amazon QuickSight account, use the procedure in [Viewing User Account Details](#view-user-accounts-enterprise)\. 

If you later need to reactivate a user account, put the user into a group with access to Amazon QuickSight\. This restores their access to Amazon QuickSight and to any existing resources that are still associated with that user account\. 

You can activate or deactivate multiple user accounts at once by adding or removing one or more Microsoft Active Directory directory groups from integration with Amazon QuickSight\. 

**Important**  
Removing all groups and users doesn't remove any resources and doesn't cancel your subscription to Amazon QuickSight\.

Use the following procedure to remove a Microsoft Active Directory directory group from Amazon QuickSight\.

1. Choose your user name on the application bar and then choose **Manage QuickSight**\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/images/admin-menu.png)

1. Choose **Manage Users**\.

1. Choose **Manage groups**\.

1. On the AWS sign\-in page, enter your AWS or IAM credentials\.

1. Locate the group you want remove under either the **Administrator groups** or the **User groups** section, and then choose the `x`\-shaped delete icon\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/images/deactivate-groups.png)

1.  In the **Manage users** screen, You can view each deactivated user in the **Deleted user** section\. This is located beneath the **Active users this month** section\. 

    To transfer the user's resources, click on the **Action** "x" button beside that user's name\. You are prompted to decide what to do with resources owned solely by that user\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/images/transfer-resources.png)

   Choose one of the following:
   +  Transfer ownership of all orphaned resources to a different user in this account\. 
   +  Delete all orphaned resources\. \(This frees the user's [SPICE](welcome.md#spice) capacity\.\) 
**Warning**  
This action can't be undone\!  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/images/confirm-deleted-account.png)

   Whichever action you choose applies to all resources owned solely by that user\. If you transfer the user's resources, Amazon QuickSight reassigns them to the user you choose\. It doesn't make unnecessary duplicates of those resources\.

## Deleting Enterprise User Accounts<a name="delete-a-user-account-enterprise"></a>

Deleting a user account works the same way in both the Standard and Enterprise editions of Amazon QuickSight\. User accounts can be deleted by a Amazon QuickSight administrator\. To delete a user account, use the procedure in [Deleting a User Account](managing-users.md#delete-a-user-account)\.
