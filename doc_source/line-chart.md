# Working with a Line Chart<a name="line-chart"></a>

Use line charts to compare changes in values for one or more measures or dimensions over a period of time\. Line charts differ from area line charts in that each value is represented by a line instead of a colored area of the chart\.

Line charts show up to 2500 data points on the X axis when no color field is selected\. When color is populated, line charts show up to 200 data points on the X axis and up to 25 data points for color\. For more information about how data that falls outside the display limit for this visual type, see [Display Limits in Visuals](working-with-visual-types.md#display-limits)\.

The icon for a line chart is as follows:

## Line Chart Features<a name="line-chart-features"></a>

Use the following table to understand the features supported by line charts\.


****  

| Feature | Supported? | Comments | For More Information | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Changing the legend display | Yes |  | [Displaying the Visual Legend](formatting-a-visual.md#displaying-the-visual-legend) | 
| Changing the title display | Yes |  | [Displaying a Visual's Title](formatting-a-visual.md#displaying-visual-title) | 
| Changing the axis range | Yes | You can set the range for the Y axis\. | [Changing the Axis Range](formatting-a-visual.md#changing-axis-range) | 
| Changing the visual colors | Yes |  | [Changing Visual Colors in Amazon QuickSight](changing-visual-colors.md) | 
| Focusing on or excluding elements | Yes, with exceptions | You can focus on or exclude any line on the chart, except in the following cases: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/line-chart.html) In these cases, you can only focus on a line, not exclude it\. |  [Focusing on Visual Elements](focusing-on-visual-elements.md) [Excluding Visual Elements](excluding-visual-elements.md) | 
| Sorting | Yes | You can sort on the fields you choose for the X axis and the value\. | [Sorting Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](sorting-visual-data.md) | 
| Field aggregation | Yes | You must apply aggregation to the field you choose for the value, and can't apply aggregation to the fields you choose for the X axis and color\. | [Changing Field Aggregation](changing-field-aggregation.md) | 
| Adding drill\-downs | Yes | You can add drill\-down levels to the X axis and Color field wells\. | [Adding Drill\-Downs to Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](adding-drill-downs.md) | 

## Creating a Line Chart<a name="create-measure-line-chart"></a>

Use the following procedure to create a line chart\.

1. On the analysis page, choose **Visualize** on the tool bar\.

1. Choose **Add** on the application bar, and then choose **Add visual**\.

1. On the **Visual types** pane, choose the line chart icon\.

1. From the **Fields list** pane, drag the fields you want to use to the appropriate field wells\. Typically, you want to use dimension or measure fields as indicated by the target field well\. If you choose to use a dimension field as a measure, the **Count** aggregate function is automatically applied to it to create a numeric value\.

   + To create a single\-measure line chart, drag a dimension to the **X axis** field well and one measure to the **Value** field well\.

   + To create a multi\-measure line chart, drag a dimension to the **X axis** field well and two or more measures to the **Value** field well\. Leave the **Color** field well empty\.

   + To create a multi\-dimension line chart, drag a dimension to the **X axis** field well, one measure to the **Value** field well, and one dimension to the **Color** field well\.

1. \(Optional\) Add drill\-down layers by dragging one or more additional fields to the **X axis** or **Color** field wells\. For more information about adding drill\-downs, see [Adding Drill\-Downs to Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](adding-drill-downs.md)\.
