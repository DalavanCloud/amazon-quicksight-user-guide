# Sharing Dashboards<a name="sharing-a-dashboard"></a>

After you create a dashboard, you can share it with additional users\. Once you share a dashboard, you can review the other users that have access to it, and also revoke access from any user\.

**Note**  
In some cases, for dashboards shared before Sept 25 2017, the user setting for **Can create analyses** can become locked in the off setting\. To fix this, enable the option, and reshare the dashboard with that user\. Refresh the screen to see the most current settings\.
