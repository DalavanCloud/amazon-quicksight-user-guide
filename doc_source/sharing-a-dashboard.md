# Sharing Dashboards<a name="sharing-a-dashboard"></a>

After you create a dashboard, you can share it with additional users\. Once you share a dashboard, you can review the other users that have access to it, and also revoke access from any user\.

**Note**  
In some cases, for dashboards shared before Sept 25 2017, the user setting for **Can create analyses** can become locked in the off setting\. To fix this, reshare the dashboard with that user, and enable the option at that time\. Refresh the screen to see the most current settings\.
