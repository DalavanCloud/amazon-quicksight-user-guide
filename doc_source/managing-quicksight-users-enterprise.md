Your account administrator can add and remove Microsoft Active Directory directory groups to create and deactivate user accounts\. To do this, the administrator must have both administrative privileges in Amazon QuickSight and also appropriate AWS permissions\. 

Individual Amazon QuickSight users are created or deactivated when a network administrator adds or removes them from the directory group\. Deactivating groups or users removes their access to Amazon QuickSight resources\. However, it doesn't delete the user's subscription or any resources they own\. 

Removing all groups from Amazon QuickSight doesn't remove any resources and doesn't unsubscribe you from Amazon QuickSight\.
