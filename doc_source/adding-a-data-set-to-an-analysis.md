# Adding a Data Set to an Analysis<a name="adding-a-data-set-to-an-analysis"></a>

After you have created an analysis using an initial data set, you can add more data sets to the analysis that you can also use to create visuals\. Each visual can only use one data set\.

From within the analysis, you can open any data set for editing, for example to add or remove fields, or perform other data preparation\. For more information about editing a data set, see [Editing a Data Set](edit-a-data-set.md)\.

The currently selected data set displays at the top of the **Fields list** pane\. This is the data set that is used by the currently selected visual\. Choosing a different visual changes the selected data set to the one used by that visual\.

To change the selected data set manually, choose the data set list at the top of the **Fields list** pane and then choose a different data set\. This deselects the currently selected visual if it doesn't use this data set; either choose a visual that uses the selected data set, or choose **Add** on the application bar and then **Add Visual** to create a new visual using the selected data set\.

If you choose **Suggested** on the tool bar to see suggested visuals, you'll see visuals based on the currently selected data set\.

Only filters for the currently selected data set are shown in the **Filter** pane, and you can only create filters on the currently selected data set\.
